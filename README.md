# CIFAR-10 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Project
This repository contains a Python script for training and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Keras. It includes steps for data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Description
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. This project aims to build a CNN to accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

## Features
* Data Visualization: Visualize the CIFAR-10 dataset images.
* Data Preprocessing: Normalize image data and convert labels to one-hot encoding.
* CNN Model: Build and train a CNN model with Keras.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different model architectures and parameters.
* Results Visualization: Plot the performance metrics for different hyperparameter combinations.

# Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Keras
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
